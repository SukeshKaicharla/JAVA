what if my child class has lesser access modifier?

If a child class has a lesser access modifier than its parent class, it means that the child class is reducing the visibility of inherited methods or members compared 
to its parent class. This violates the principle of inheritance because it restricts access to the methods or members that were previously available to subclasses.

In object-oriented programming languages like Java, access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. The access modifiers include public,
protected, default (package-private), and private.


2. Calc, scientific calc, programmer calc - implement complete inheritance(overriding,uniq methd...)


Calulator:
        ADD()
        SUB()
        DIV()
        MUL()

Standard Calulator:
        ADD()----
        SUB()   |
                  ====OVERRIDE
        DIV()   |
        MUL()----
        PERCENTAGE()==UNIQUE

Scientific Calulator:
        ADD()----
        SUB()   |
                  ====OVERRIDE
        DIV()   |
        MUL()----
        Trignometry()---|
        Function()------|==UNIQUE
        MODULUS() ------|

Programmer Calculator:
        ADD()----
        SUB()   |
                  ====OVERRIDE
        DIV()   |
        MUL()----
        BITWISE()-----|
        BITSHIFT()----|==UNIQUE
        CONVERSIONS()-|


Standard Calc extends (is a) Calulator  => Stan Calc can access all the methods of Calculator and some unique methods (if method is not private)
Scientific Calc extends (is a) Calulator  => Sci Calc can access all the methods of Calculator and some unique methods (if method is not private)
Programmer Calc extends (is a) Calulator  => Prog Calc can access all the methods of Calculator and some unique methods (if method is not private)


3. Radio, Tv, Dvd Player - identify the Apt parent class and implement inheritance


Electronic Device:
      Turn ON\OFF()
      Volume()
      Signal()
      Play()
      Stop()

Radio:
    Turn ON\OFF()
      Volume()
      Signal()
      Play()
      Stop()
      Channels()--U
TV:
    Turn ON\OFF()
      Volume()
      Signal()
      Play()
      Stop()
      Channels()--U
      Picture()---U
DVD:
      Turn ON\OFF()
      Volume()
      Pause\Play()---U
      Stop()
      Playback()--U

4. Admin, Manager, Finance - idetify the parent class and implement inheritance

Department 
     login() 
     logout() 
     campany() 
Admin
    login() 
     logout() 
     campany() 
    AdminId()---U

Manager  
     login() 
     logout() 
     campany() 
      Id()--U
     employee data()---U
     
Finance  

     login() 
     logout() 
     campany() 
     accounts()---U
     salary()-----U
